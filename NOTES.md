    I had a hard time trying to understand things together, searching sollutions on internet and stuff, but i realized what's wrong.
    I'm using **Visual Studio Code** while Casey and most of users i found are using **Visual Studio**.

    My biggest strugle was how to set up stuff. In VS (Visual Studio) you have your workspaces treated as a project, and have properties setup, in VSC (Visual Studio Code) you have a workspace just like it is.

    i'm using VSC to just write the code, i compile it and run it on the terminal, i don't know how to debug on terminal.
